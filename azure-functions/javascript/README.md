# Quickstart: Create a JavaScript function in Azure using Visual Studio Code

[EXAMPLE: Using the Azure Portal](./demo-azure-portal/README.md)

See [Quickstart: Create a JavaScript function in Azure from the command line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-node?tabs=macos%2Cazure-cli%2Cbrowser&pivots=nodejs-model-v4)

## Configure your local environment

```sh
# PREREQUISITE: Install the Azure CLI tool on macOS
% brew update && brew install azure-cli
rob@prism javascript % brew update && brew install azure-cli
==> Updating Homebrew...
Already up-to-date.
Warning: azure-cli 2.63.0 is already installed and up-to-date.
To reinstall 2.63.0, run:
  brew reinstall azure-cli

# PREREQUISITE: Install the Azure Functions Core Tools on macOS
#   => Install homebrew if it's not already installed - https://brew.sh/
% brew tap azure/functions
% brew install azure-functions-core-tools@4

```

## Create a local function project

```sh
# Create a folder for our function project
% mkdir demo-azure-cli

# Navigate to the folder containing our function project
% cd demo-azure-cli

# Initialize an Azure Functions project
% func init --javascript

# Add HttpExample as a public function using an HTTP Trigger
% func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "anonymous" 
Select a number for template:HTTP trigger
Function name: [httpTrigger] Creating a new file /Users/rob/repos/azure-certification-renewal-az-204-azure-developer-associate/azure-functions/javascript/demo-azure-cli/src/functions/HttpExample.js
The function "HttpExample" was created successfully from the "HTTP trigger" template.

# OPTIONAL: Want to learn more about what httptrigger is?
% func help httptrigger
 The HTTP trigger lets you invoke a function with an HTTP request. You can use an HTTP trigger to build serverless APIs and respond to webhooks. 

Programming model v4 for Node is currently in preview. The goal of this model is to introduce a more intuitive and idiomatic way of authoring Function triggers and bindings for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. Learn more http://aka.ms/AzFuncNodeV4. %

## Run the function locally

```sh
# Make sure you are in the Azure Function project folder
% func start

## Create supporting Azure resources for your function

Before you can deploy your function code to Azure, you need to create three resources:

- A resource group, which is a logical container for related resources.
- A Storage account, which is used to maintain state and other information about your functions.
- A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app maps to your local function project and lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

```sh
# Make sure you have logged in to Azure
% az login

# Create a resource group
% az group create --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --location westus

# Create a general-purpose storage account named sademorb in your resource group and region
% az storage account create --name sademorb --location westus --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access false

# Create the function app in Azure 
% az functionapp create --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location westus --runtime node --runtime-version 20 --functions-version 4 --name sademorb --storage-account sademorb

```

## Deploy the function project to Azure

```sh
# Publish to Azure
% func azure functionapp publish sademorb

Functions in sademorb:
    HttpExample - [httpTrigger]
        Invoke url: https://sademorb.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample

```

In the above example, we can see that our httpexample function has been deployed to [https://sademorb.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample](https://sademorb.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample) ðŸ¤“

## Invoke the function on Azure

Open a browser and test your function by adding a `name` query parameter to the URL - [https://sademorb.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample?name=Rob](https://sademorb.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample?name=Rob)

You can run the following command to view near real-time streaming logs:

```sh

## Clean up resources

```sh
# Delete the resource group and all of the resources it contains
% az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg

```

NOTE: This command may take a little bit of time.
